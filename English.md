1. At the cost of some upfront time and memory to create these beans before they are actually needed, you discover configuration issues when the ApplicationContext is created, not later.
2. "On Writing Well" offers you fundamental priciples as well as the insights of a distinguished writer and teacher. With more than a million copies sold, this volume has stood the test of time and remains a valuable resource for writers and would-be writers.
3. Using archetypes provides a great way to enable developers quickly in a way consistent with best practices employed by your project or organization. 
4. As you can see from the output.
5. Upon executing this command you should see output like the following:
6. 'Quick and easy' doesn't mean that a resulting application will suffer from a maintainability or a performance issue. Netty has been designed carefully with the experiences earned from the implementation of a lot of protocols such as FTP, SMTP, HTTP, and various binary and text-based legacy protocols. As a result, Netty has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, and flexibility without a compromise.
7. What matters in this case is how quickly we can implement that protocol while not sacrificing the stability and performance of the resulting application.
8. Netty is designed to give you the most comfortable experience both in terms of the API and the implementation from the day one. It is not something tangible but you will realize that this philosophy will make your life much easier as you read this guide and play with Netty.
9. In contrast,...
10. Another point to note is that...
11. At the other end of the spectrum
12. In this first chapter, we’ll begin with background on high-performance networking, particularly its implementation in the Java Development Kit (JDK). With this context in place, we’ll introduce Netty, its core concepts, and building blocks. By the end of the chapter, you’ll be ready to tackle your first Netty-based client and server.
13. is a cumbersome and error-prone task best left to a high-performance networking expert—Netty.
14. Not so long ago the scenario we presented at the outset
15. For many of us they have become indispensable, enabling us to meet both our technical requirements and our schedules.
16. From the point of view of networking, 
17. For now: 目前眼下
18. Over time
19. In this post, we will learn about the difference between abstract class and Interface and when should we use interface over abstract class and vice versa.
20. We'll explore Netty from two distinct but closely related points of view: as a class library and as a framework. Both are essential to writing efficient...
21. From a high-level perspective, Netty addresses two corresponding areas of concern, which we might label broadly as technical and architectural.
22. Netty's alternative to ByteBuffer is ByteBuf.
23. Because we must guard against the possible side effects of concurrent execution.
24. Ignoring these matters and merely hoping for the best is tantamount to gambling - with the odds definitely against you.
25. Pooling and reusing is an improvement over creating and destroying a thread with each task, but it doesn't eliminate the cost of context switching, which quickly becomes apparent as the number of threads increases and can be severe under heavy load.
26. Could you please use this template to better understanding of the the proble you are facing to.
27. the protocol most widely used is ...
28. These are the ones we'll discuss in appendix, leaving aside some that would be certainly required by project intended for production deployment.
29. The first three of these combine to form the unique identifier and are the mechanism by which you specify which version of external libraries your project will use.
30. when this occurs, if you don't stop writing you risk running out of memory.
31. of varying types.
32. Whenever you want to customize the build of a Maven project, this is done by adding or reconfiguring plugins.
33. This is as simple as adding this to your POM
34. You'll notice that all the plugins in Maven look much like a dependency - and in some ways they are.
35. However, even though a build phase is responsible for a specific step in build lifecycle, the manner in which it carries out those responsibilities may vary.
36. The order used is that the packaging are executed first, followed by those configured in the POM.
