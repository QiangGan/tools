1. At the cost of some upfront time and memory to create these beans before they are actually needed, you discover configuration issues when the ApplicationContext is created, not later.
2. "On Writing Well" offers you fundamental priciples as well as the insights of a distinguished writer and teacher. With more than a million copies sold, this volume has stood the test of time and remains a valuable resource for writers and would-be writers.
3. Using archetypes provides a great way to enable developers quickly in a way consistent with best practices employed by your project or organization. 
4. As you can see from the output.
5. Upon executing this command you should see output like the following:
6. 'Quick and easy' doesn't mean that a resulting application will suffer from a maintainability or a performance issue. Netty has been designed carefully with the experiences earned from the implementation of a lot of protocols such as FTP, SMTP, HTTP, and various binary and text-based legacy protocols. As a result, Netty has succeeded to find a way to achieve ease of development, performance, stability, and flexibility without a compromise.
7. What matters in this case is how quickly we can implement that protocol while not sacrificing the stability and performance of the resulting application.
8. Netty is designed to give you the most comfortable experience both in terms of the API and the implementation from the day one. It is not something tangible but you will realize that this philosophy will make your life much easier as you read this guide and play with Netty.
9. In contrast,...
10. Another point to note is that...
11. At the other end of the spectrum
12. In this first chapter, we’ll begin with background on high-performance networking, particularly its implementation in the Java Development Kit (JDK). With this context in place, we’ll introduce Netty, its core concepts, and building blocks. By the end of the chapter, you’ll be ready to tackle your first Netty-based client and server.
13. is a cumbersome and error-prone task best left to a high-performance networking expert—Netty.
14. Not so long ago the scenario we presented at the outset
15. For many of us they have become indispensable, enabling us to meet both our technical requirements and our schedules.
16. From the point of view of networking, 
17. For now
18. Over time
19. In this post, we will learn about the difference between abstract class and Interface and when should we use interface over abstract class and vice versa.
